# Namespace definitions are parsed in four distinct sections
# < "prepend" : "separator" : "namespace" : "postpend" >
# definitions start with a < and the first section called a prepend is defined as follows:
#	prepend samples: "?[2]Artist", "[:-5]", "?("
#
#	? as the first character implies the namespace is optional, if this is omitted
#		then the compilation will fail and the next definition wil be tried
#	[ as the next character opens a limiter definition which looks like [N:M]
#		where N is the max instances of this namespace to use and M is the
#		max length of the string produced by this namespace.
#		The limiter can be defined with or without N and M as long as one
#		of them is supplied, for example: [:M] [N] [N:-M] [:-M]
#	The rest of the prepend section defines what will go before the namespace
#		as long as at least one namespace is available
# : closes the prepend section and start the separator section
#	separator sample: ", "
#
#	The separator section is pretty straight forward
#		it's what's used in between namespace instances
# : closes the separator section and start the namespace section
#	namespace samples: "creator!unknown artist=unknown", "character|species=renamon=gatomon"
#
#	any characters define the namespace
#	=/! after the namespace makes it conditional
#		where = is equality and ! is inequality
#		each condition is separated by an =
#	| will initiate a new namespace
# : closes the namespace section and start the postpend section
#	postpend sample: ")"
#
#	postpends characters after the namespace
# > closes the postpend section
#
# Some post metadata available are:
#	ID
#	Cid
#	Sha256
#	Md5
#	Ext (filename extension)


# Multiple definitions can be supplied, the first one to succeed is used
# if all definitions fail then the application will exit so it's a good
# idea to use a guaranteed fallback

# Here are some useful definitions
# Uncomment to use
